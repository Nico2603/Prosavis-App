# Application Blueprint

This document outlines the project's style, design, and features.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to fix the `ProviderNotFoundException` for `AuthBloc`. This includes:

*   **Dependencies:** Make sure all the dependencies are correct.
*   **Theming:** Create a centralized theme file with light and dark mode support, custom color schemes, and typography.
*   **State Management:** Correctly provide the `AuthBloc` to the widget tree.
*   **UI Integration:** Apply the new theme to the main application.
*   **Firebase:** Add all the required dependencies to use Firebase.
*   **Routing:** Add `go_router` to handle all the routing in the app.
*   **App Structure:** Restructure the app to follow the best standards.
